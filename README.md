### Enhanced Player Statistics
Thereâ€™s great potential to track and add many of the available advanced statistics in today's NBA. The most notable statistic is Usage rate, which reflects how often a player is used while on the court. James Harden is an example of a player with a very high usage rate, because the ball is almost always in his posession and he does most of the scoring and offensive creation. Thus, having too many players with a high usage rate should have diminishing results, as the players will not share the ball well. Essentially, a team of ball hogs should not play as well as a balanced team. With the right statistical model I believe this is achievable.

### Connect to Basketball Reference Database
Additionally, it would be great to expand the player component to include more statistics. If I could connect with an API that collects basketball player data it would be feasible to build a roster with any player in NBA history as opposed to a preselected set of players (which is very much one persons opinion, there's a bunch of great players I omitted choosing just 25).

### Search by category
We'd like to have implemented a search by category, where a user could select a player category and only have players of that category appear.

## Document your planning, process and problem-solving strategy
I had seen a tweet a few months ago that inspired the project:
